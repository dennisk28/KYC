# KYC System Development Progress

## Overview
A complete KYC (Know Your Customer) identity verification system with Spring Boot backend, React web console, and Android client.

## Completed Features

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- **Core KYC Process Engine**: Manages verification workflow with configurable steps
- **Async Workflow System**: ID verification → Face verification with extensible node support
- **File Upload Management**: Secure handling of ID documents and face photos
- **MongoDB Integration**: Data persistence for KYC processes and workflow configurations
- **Admin APIs**: Complete CRUD operations for KYC management
- **Image Serving API**: Endpoint for displaying uploaded documents in web console
- **Third-party Integration**: Async callback system for external verification services

### Web Console (React + TypeScript)
- **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and KYC process overview
- **KYC Management**: List view with filtering, pagination, and search
- **Detail Views**: Comprehensive KYC process details with timeline visualization
- **Image Display**: Direct viewing of uploaded ID cards and face photos
- **Admin Operations**: Delete, refresh, and status management

### Android App (Kotlin)
- **Document Capture**: Camera integration for ID card photography
- **Face Photo Capture**: Real-time face photo capture with validation
- **File Upload**: Async upload with progress tracking
- **Status Polling**: Real-time verification status updates
- **Material Design UI**: Modern Android interface

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture & Design
- **Microservices Ready**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking workflow execution with callback-driven updates
- **Flexible Workflow**: Configurable verification steps through database-driven workflow engine
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin setup for multi-platform access

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Java Best Practices**: Proper file structure with one public class per file
- **Dependency Management**: Resolved WebClient connectivity issues with WebFlux integration
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling across all layers

### File Structure Standardization
```
Backend (Spring Boot):
├── controllers/     # REST API endpoints
├── services/        # Business logic layer
├── repositories/    # Data access layer
├── models/          # MongoDB entities
├── dto/             # Data transfer objects (properly separated)
└── config/          # Application configuration

Frontend (React):
├── pages/          # Main application screens
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── services/       # API integration layer
└── types/          # TypeScript definitions

Android (Kotlin):
├── activities/     # Main application screens
├── data/api/       # Network layer
└── data/model/     # Data classes
```

## Key Fixes Applied

### Spring Boot Dependency Issues
- Added `spring-boot-starter-webflux` to resolve WebClient ClientHttpConnector errors
- Removed redundant dependencies to prevent conflicts

### Java Code Structure
- Split consolidated DTO file into individual class files:
  - `KycUploadRequest.java`
  - `KycUploadResponse.java`
  - `KycStatusResponse.java`
  - `ThirdPartyCallbackRequest.java`
- Updated all import statements across controllers and services
- Moved WebConfig class from Main.java to proper WebConfig.java file

### Frontend Integration
- Implemented image display functionality in KYC detail view
- Fixed TypeScript type compatibility issues
- Added proper error handling for image loading

## Current System Status

### Backend Features ✅
- KYC process management
- File upload and storage
- Workflow execution engine
- Admin management APIs
- Image serving capability
- MongoDB data persistence
- Third-party service integration

### Web Console Features ✅
- KYC process listing and filtering
- Detailed process view with timeline
- Image display for uploaded documents
- Admin operations (delete, refresh)
- Real-time status updates

### Android App Features ✅
- Document photography and upload
- Face photo capture and upload

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Testing Capabilities
- **Backend**: JUnit tests with embedded MongoDB
- **Web Console**: Jest testing framework
- **Android**: Espresso UI testing
- **API Testing**: curl scripts and Postman collections provided

### Manual Testing Tools
- `test-api.bat`: Automated API endpoint testing
- Postman collection for comprehensive API testing
- Android emulator testing setup

## MongoDB Configuration
- Database: `kyc_db` (production), `kyc_db_test` (testing)
- Auto-initialization of default workflow configuration
- Proper indexing for performance optimization

## Production Readiness
- Environment-specific configuration via application.yml
- Proper error handling and logging
- Security considerations for file access
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Scalable async processing architecture

## Recent Development Summary

### Session-Based KYC Architecture
- **Refactored KYC Flow**: Separated session creation from document upload for flexible workflow configuration
- **New API Endpoint**: `POST /api/kyc/session` creates KYC sessions independently of uploads
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Upload endpoints now accept existing KYC IDs, allowing arbitrary workflow sequencing

### Mock Server Integration
- **Complete Mock Server**: Standalone Spring Boot application simulating third-party verification services
- **Async Callback System**: Mock server sends verification results via callbacks after realistic delays (3-8 seconds)
- **Test Coverage**: ID verification, face verification, and deepfake detection endpoints
- **Manual Testing Tools**: Scripts for complete end-to-end workflow testing

### Integration Architecture
- **Service Integration**: ThirdPartyService now calls mock server endpoints on localhost:9090
- **Callback Handling**: Complete callback processing for verification results
- **Test Scripts**: Comprehensive testing suite including complete flow automation

### Current Stable Architecture
```
KYC Server (8080) ←→ Mock Server (9090)
     ↑                      ↓
Web Console (3000)    Async Callbacks
     ↑
